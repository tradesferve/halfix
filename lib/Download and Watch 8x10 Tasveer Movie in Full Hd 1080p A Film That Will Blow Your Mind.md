## 8 x 10 Tasveer Movie Review
 
Before you watch *8 x 10 Tasveer* movie online, you might want to know what the critics and audiences have said about it. The film received mixed reviews from both the critics and the audiences, with some praising it for its concept and performances, while others criticizing it for its execution and climax. The film has a rating of 5.4 out of 10 on IMDb, based on 5,900 user ratings. Here are some of the positive and negative reviews of the film:
 
### Positive Reviews

- "A thriller that will keep one glued to the seat all the way through as it revolves around a man who has the ability to see the past and he uses it to help others, even though it can kill him." - Pratik112 on IMDb
- "That being said, 8 X 10 Tasveer is not your typical Bollywood film. It's an out-and-out action thriller that feels like an international film as it entertains without compromising on quality. I'd love to collect it, as the stunts and twists have really left me impressed more than any Akshay Kumar film I have seen till date." - AvinashPatalay on IMDb
- "A suspense story about a man with the supernatural gift to read the past through photographs is stretched to its limits -- along with the viewer's patience -- in a slick but ultimately disappointing thriller." - The Hollywood Reporter

### Negative Reviews

- "The movie starts off well but loses steam midway. The climax is a letdown and the logic goes for a toss. Akshay Kumar tries hard but fails to rise above the weak script. Ayesha Takia is wasted in a thankless role. Jaaved Jaaferi is annoying as the comic relief. The music is forgettable and the editing is choppy." - Rajeev Masand on CNN-IBN
- "8 x 10 Tasveer had potential to be a good thriller but it falls flat due to poor direction and screenplay. The film is slow, boring and predictable. The dialogues are cheesy and the acting is mediocre. The only saving grace is the cinematography which captures the scenic locations of Canada and South Africa." - Taran Adarsh on Bollywood Hungama
- "8 x 10 Tasveer is a mess of a movie that tries to be too clever for its own good. The film is full of loopholes, inconsistencies and absurdities that make no sense. The film wastes a talented cast and a novel idea in a convoluted plot that fails to thrill or engage. The film is neither entertaining nor intelligent." - Raja Sen on Rediff.com

As you can see, *8 x 10 Tasveer* movie has received mixed reviews from both the critics and the audiences. However, you can still watch it online and form your own opinion about it. You might like it or hate it, but you won't know until you watch it.
