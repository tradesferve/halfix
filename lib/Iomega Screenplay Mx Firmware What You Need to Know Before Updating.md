But what if you want to get the best performance and compatibility from your device? You may need to update its firmware from time to time. Firmware is the software that controls the hardware of your device. Updating it can fix bugs, improve stability and add new features.
 
In this article, we will show you how to update your Iomega ScreenPlay MX firmware in a few easy steps. You will need a computer with internet access, a USB flash drive and your Iomega ScreenPlay MX device.
 
## Step 1: Download the latest firmware
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the latest firmware for your device from the official website of Iomega. You can find it here: [^1^]. The file name is `Iomega_ScreenPlay_MX2_Firmware_10005.zip`. Save it to your computer and unzip it. You should see a file called `install.img`.
 
## Step 2: Copy the firmware file to your USB flash drive
 
Next, you need to copy the firmware file to your USB flash drive. Make sure your USB flash drive is formatted in FAT32 or NTFS file system. If not, you can format it using your computer. Then, copy the `install.img` file to the root directory of your USB flash drive. Do not put it in any folder or rename it.
 
## Step 3: Connect your USB flash drive to your Iomega ScreenPlay MX
 
Now, you need to connect your USB flash drive to your Iomega ScreenPlay MX device. Turn on your device and your TV. Make sure your device is connected to your TV via HDMI or composite cable. Then, plug in your USB flash drive to the USB port on the back of your device.
 
## Step 4: Update your firmware
 
Finally, you need to update your firmware. On your TV screen, you should see a menu with four options: Movies, Music, Photos and Setup. Use the remote control to select Setup and press OK. Then, select System and press OK. You should see an option called Firmware Upgrade. Select it and press OK.
 
Your device will detect the firmware file on your USB flash drive and ask you if you want to upgrade. Select Yes and press OK. The upgrade process will start and you will see a progress bar on your TV screen. Do not turn off your device or unplug your USB flash drive during this process.
 
When the upgrade is complete, your device will reboot automatically. You can then unplug your USB flash drive and enjoy your updated Iomega ScreenPlay MX.
