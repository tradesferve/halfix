One of the official sources of solutions is the Pearson website, which provides answers for the International A Level Physics books[^1^]. You can download PDF files for each unit and topic, and compare them with your own work. However, these solutions may not match exactly with the Edexcel AS Physics Student Book, as they are designed for a different qualification.
 
Another option is to use the online content finder for Mathematics[^1^], which also covers some aspects of Physics. You can enter the ISBN of your student book and access extra online content, such as worked solutions, videos, animations, and interactive quizzes. This can help you reinforce your learning and practice your skills.
 
A third possibility is to look for unofficial sources of solutions, such as websites, blogs, forums, or YouTube channels that offer explanations and guidance for Edexcel AS Physics. For example, you can find some videos on YouTube that cover some chapters of the student book[^3^]. However, you should be careful with these sources, as they may not be accurate or reliable.
 
In conclusion, finding solutions for Edexcel AS Physics Student Book can be challenging, but not impossible. You can use official Pearson resources, online content finder, or unofficial sources to check your answers and enhance your learning. However, you should always try to solve the problems by yourself first, and use the solutions only as a reference or a feedback tool.
  
If you want to get the most out of your Edexcel AS Physics Student Book, you should also use other resources and strategies to complement your learning. For example, you can use the specification and sample assessment materials from the Pearson website to familiarize yourself with the content and format of the exams. You can also use past papers and mark schemes to practice your exam skills and identify your strengths and weaknesses.
